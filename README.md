# LBXStripper2

Installation:

Create a folder within /REAPER/Scripts/LBX/

Place LBX Stripper 2.lua file into this folder.

Unpack the LBXCS_Resources folder into this folder - so that it creates /REAPER/Scripts/LBX/LBXCS_resources/ folder (which contains all the separate resource files and folders).

Please note - this version is tested by myself - but not had a rigourous public test yet.  There may be bugs - which I will endeavour to fix when I'm notified about them.
